This project is a simple calculator 
using Java RMI. 
The server performs arithmetic operations 
(add, subtract, multiply, divide) and 
the client provides a GUI with two input 
fields and four buttons. The first field 
is used as the first number and 
the second field as the second number. 
When a button is clicked, the client 
sends the numbers to the server, 
which performs the operation and 
returns the result, shown in the GUI. 
Subtraction and division use the 
first number minus/divided by the second.
